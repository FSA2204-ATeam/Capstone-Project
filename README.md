## Start

Databases must be created:
createdb urban-safari

Sync and seed your database by running `npm run seed`. Running `npm run start:dev` will make great things happen!

- start:dev will both start your server and build your client side files using webpack
- start:dev:logger is the same as start:dev, but you will see your SQL queries (can be helpful for debugging)
- start:dev:seed will start your server and also seed your database (this is useful when you are making schema changes and you don't want to run your seed script separately)

### Future Development

### Features & Previews

# Short Description

Urban Safari is a roulette style guide to the wildlife of NYC. Using proximity-based mapping, event listing APIs and community sourced parties, this guide application provides users with recommended events. These events can be weighted by category and the randomizer is capable of utilizing the sentiment analysis curated from reviews in conjunction with users' preferences to serve up events that fit their tastes.

# Long Description

Urban Safari was built on a tech stack that includes: dbdiagram.io, Figma, Trello, GitHub, Slack, Visual Studio Code, NodeJS, PostgresSQL, Express, Sequelize, React-Redux, Material UI, HTML5 and CSS. Third party API information utilized within this project include: GoogleMaps, New York City Events, Mozilla's Web Speech, and IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding.
We utilized a combination of MUI and Google Maps to create a single page application accessible by both mobile and desktop browsers.

Urban Safari was created from a brainstorm session that focused on delivering a unique product. Our team took great interest in collaborating to design specialty logic structures and successfully implemented data extraction and switch cases for use in our single page application. Our most valuable learning lessons were in the research stage of our production pipeline; during our proof of concept build out. For API calls, we implemented individual and paired programming to integrate them into the final product.

This product was designed remotely and our team is very proud of overcoming the challenges associated with online work environments.
