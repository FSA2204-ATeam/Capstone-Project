# Urban Safari

Never know where to go? Need to boost your guestlist numbers?

URBAN SAFARI is a roulette style guide to the wildlife of NYC. Using proximity-based mapping, event listing APIs and community sourced parties, let us help you find your way to the outback of your imagination.

Feeling Wild? Sign up now to RSVP to, or create, an upcoming event! Navigate to 'My Events' to view details and submit reviews. Our API will run a sentiment analysis of your feedback and better direct you to future events that match your preferences!

## Team Members

We are a team of urban explorers from the four corners of the United States. As part of our academic experience at Fullstack Academy, we have collaborated on providing NYC residents with an app to inspire civic and community engagement.

## Start

Databases must be created:
createdb urban-safari

Sync and seed your database by running `npm run seed`. Running `npm run start:dev` will make great things happen!

- start:dev will both start your server and build your client side files using webpack
- start:dev:logger is the same as start:dev, but you will see your SQL queries (can be helpful for debugging)
- start:dev:seed will start your server and also seed your database (this is useful when you are making schema changes and you don't want to run your seed script separately)
